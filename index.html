    <section class="main-content">
      <p> <a href="http://www.steemit.com">Steemit</a> is a very flexible platform, rewarding writers and bloggers its only a small part of what can be done with the steem blockchain. We have seen how steemit has been used to crowdfund not only the development of new tools but also social projects like feeding homeless people and streets dogs.</p>

<p>However there are houndreds of projects asking for backing that are left behind, unnoticed by most steemians. This happens to new users that dont have many followers, users who use the wrong tag or publish at the wrong time and some users are just unlucky. </p>

<p>The idea of @steemfund is to organize and filter crowdfunding projects while providing some extra exposure to those worthy projects on steemit. In order to do this in an effective manner we would need to follow a set of rules:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Users who apply for funding (applicants) would need to provide a brief description of their project, main goals,  objectives and an estimated timeline of completion.</p></li>
<li><p>Applicants must also provide a real I.D. and proof of residence via private steemit.chat or e-mail. If you are going to receive money from other users, people should know who you are and where you live, you WILL be held accountable if the money is not spent on your project. <strong>Your steemit reputation is at stake.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Applicants must set a SBD goal for the campaign. All applications will be evaluated so that the amount of SBD meets the demands of the project, in this way inflating projectâ€™s budget is avoided.</p></li>
<li><p>A donate button will be generated for those people who wish to donate more than their upvote.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>SteemFund as a Lending Platform (BETA)</h2>
<p>SteemFund has added a P2P lending option to its services. The system works like many others P2P lending platform, but it will have steemit reputation as an added security for investors. A borrower with high reputation is less likely to commit fraud since he would be risking potential future blogging rewards.</p>
